              AustHex IRC Server Daemon Installation Instructions
            -------------------------------------------------------
		  
		  
 1. For those who just can't be bothered
    ------------------------------------
 
    Ok, so you're too lazy to read this file? Here's how you can get around
    any serious thinking to make and install this package. Lucky for you,
    this will be easy for you :)
    
    If you want to make and install the package, after untarring the package
    simply type:


       $ make install


    Lucky for you, this will automatically invoke the configuration
    script, compile, and install the package in the default location.
    
    If you wish to just make the package, omit the 'install' parameter.
    
    
    
 2. Package requirements
    --------------------
    
    The following requirements need to be forfilled for this package to work
    correctly:

     - Disk space:
     
       Compilation of the package will normally take up around 5Mb (more
       if compiled for debugging). The package will take up about 1.5Mb
       after installation.


     - C++ Standard Template Library:
      
       You will need a current copy of the C++ STL. All C++ compilers will
       have this these days. Location of the latest STL is below. The latest
       standard template library from SGI includes capabilities which will
       enhance the performance of the daemon immensely, especially under high
       load.
       
       
     - Threading library:
       
       More information later, probably looks like pthreads only though?
       
       
       
 5. Recommended additions
    ---------------------
    
    The following items are recommended

     - OpenSSL:
       
       Adding SSL to the server will allow encrypted secure server to server
       and server to client connections which can be enforced for different
       connection classes or access levels. This can greatly secure your
       server and protect important passwords which may be transmitted over
       the network
    
    
    
 4. Configuration of the package
    ----------------------------
    
    The configuration of the server's compilation time settings can be
    important performance wise

    If you're lazy (but not lazy enough to read the above) you can use these:
    
     --enable-lower-cpu
     --disable-lower-cpu (default)
     
       With this enabled, it will effect the defaults of some of the 
       feature settings in order to reduce cpu usage. The change will not
       be very dramatic, though.
       
       
     --enable-lower-memory
     --disable-lower-memory (default)
     
       With this enabled, like the option above, it will effect the default
       settings of some of the feature settings below, but this time to
       reduce any additional memory usage. The change will not be a
       dramatic one.
       


    The following features can be toggled:

     --enable-allow-clients (default)
     --disable-allow-clients
      
       This allows users (clients) to connect to the server. Disabling this 
       also has the same effect as disabling user protocols on the server if
       services are also disallowed. Normally this should be left on but 
       in the case of a hubbing server, user connections would server no 
       purpose.
     
     
     --enable-allow-servers (default)
     --disable-allow-servers

       This allows servers to connect to the server. This normally should 
       not be disabled unless the server is a stand-alone server.
      

     --enable-allow-services
     --disable-allow-services (default)

       This allows services to connect to the server. Services are like
       bots however they must have authorisation to connect as they get
       a different level of access (in some places higher access, and some 
       places lower access). Normally services use the same protocols as
       the user/client protocols, so disallowing services and clients (above)
       will result in all user protocols will be disabled. Do not confuse
       this with servers which have built in services such as ChanOP/NickOP
       etc.
      

     --enable-convert-motd-tabs (default)
     --disable-convert-motd-tabs
    
       When this is enabled, TAB characters in your MOTD file will be
       converted to a series of spaces to 'simulate' a TAB. Some clients,
       especially GUI based clients, do not understand the TAB character
       and this can result in a messy looking MOTD being sent. Disabling this
       will only change the configuration loading stage of the server, and
       the difference won't be noticeable.
       
       
     --enable-drop-lame-servers
     --disable-drop-lame-servers (default)
    
       This allows your server to drop other servers that are potentially
       spoofing data, however this may also be produced by an 'out-of-sync'
       condition which can temporarily exist on lagging connections. Arguably
       having this on is a good idea, but may become a disasterous nightmare
       on large networks, especially networks based on a star-topology.
       

     --enable-floodlock-away-reply (default = 30)
     --disable-floodlock-away-reply
     
       This enables the away-reply flood-lock. When talking to someone who's
       away, this makes the server only send a 'user is away' reply to the
       message-sending user upon the first message, and then only after a
       flood-lock timeout of the given value in seconds has expired. This
       reduces the amount of traffic leaving the server, but does use a
       tiny bit more memory. Disabling this feature follows traditional
       functionality -- an away message reply per message sent.
     
     
     --enable-floodlock-away-set (default = 45)
     --disable-floodlock-away-set

       This enables the away-set flood-lock, which reduces the amount of time
       between setting /AWAY. The user will be able to change their away
       message twice before having to wait the amount of time given (in
       seconds) to change their away message. The flood-lock remains in
       effect if they unset their away message, and they can unset it
       anytime during the floodlock. This is to reduce server traffic since
       the away message is broadcast over the network -- some scripts will
       change the away message every two seconds or so to have an 'idle 
       time' in their away message. This uses a slight bit more memory. 
       Disabling this will allow anyone to change their away message whenever 
       they like.
     

     --enable-helpers-see-umodes (default)
     --disable-helpers-see-umodes
    
       This enables helpers and operators to be able to see user modes via
       the /mode command (eg. /mode nickname). This command has the potential
       to be abused, but can be handy in instances where a user needs help
       and does not know how to see what modes they have enabled.


     --enable-ircii-kluge (default)
     --disable-ircii-kluge
    
       This enables a kluge to allow the old ircII client, and other clients
       which are technically broken by adding additional data to the server's
       output. This will generate a very slight increase in outgoing data,
       and potentially isn't even necessary these days (those clients are
       practically extinct).
       
       
     --enable-match-counting (default)
     --disable-match-counting
    
       This enables an aesthetics option to many commands that involve a
       variable list of items, such as HELP, NAMES, WHO etc. Instead of a
       simple "End of X list" (where X is the command name), it will add
       the number of matches if there is more than one match, or a 
       'no matches' message, eg. "End of X list (21 matches)". This uses only
       a very slight amount of CPU usage, but if you're being tight on the
       CPU usage you may wish to disable this as it does not effect the
       commands in any way except for the matches count message at the end.
       
      
     --enable-oper-wallops (default)
     --disable-oper-wallops

       Following IRC protocol specifications, normally nobody but servers
       are allowed to generate WALLOPS messages (sent to anyone with +w set).
       Fortunately we can bend the rules a little and allow IRC operators to
       use WALLOPS to send messages about the network to people, but
       unfortunately this can be abused, so the option to disable it exists.
       
       
     --enable-paranoid-opers
     --disable-paranoid-opers (default)
    
       This feature adds a notification to operators when they are being
       'checked out'. When a user does a WHOIS on an operator locally while
       they are online, they will receive notification that someone has
       looked at their WHOIS information. Currently this does not effect
       any other commands, but it may in the future.
       
       
     --enable-passive-registration
     --disable-passive-registration (default)
    
       This feature increases registration security by never saying anything
       to the client/server during the connection phase. This means no errors
       will be reported, instead the user is disconnected. Unfortunately
       this means that nicknames that are currently in use will result in
       people being disconnected. This may change in the future.
       
       
     --enable-strict-channel-names (default)
     --disable-strict-channel-names
    
       This enables stricter channel name checking than usual. This stops
       channels with potentially nasty characters being created, such as any
       control character, and the mysterious 'extra-space' character which
       exists in the standard ISO-8859-1 and derivative character sets. This
       will stop many fake channels by avoiding the '#foo' and '#foo^B' issue.
       
       
     --enable-strict-registration (default)
     --disable-strict-registration
    
       This enables a stricter registration process. Once a connection type
       has been established (user/server/service etc) it cannot be changed.
       This can stop many denial of service attacks which exploit the fact
       that the server is a little braindead during registration time.

       
     --enable-time-to-be-idle (default = 30)
     --disable-time-to-be-idle
     
       When enabled, idle information will only be considered/shown when
       the idle time of a user is greater than the given time (in seconds).
       This is a small addition to code, and lowers some bandwidth output.
       When this is disabled, idle times will always be shown (even it a
       person is idle 0 seconds).

     
     --enable-traceroute (default)
     --disable-traceroute
    
       This enables the traceroute command for network routing staff to use.
       This command can be used to probe other networks so it is a command
       that has the potential to be abused. Also, on some servers it may not
       be worth enabling it since it is common to firewall ICMP to the server
       to avoid some attacks. This command is useful, however, for detecting
       quality of links to other servers in instances where a simple ping
       isn't enough.
       
       
     --enable-user-conn-ping (default)
     --disable-user-conn-ping

       This feature will force clients to reply to a PING request with 
       random data upon connection to the server before allowing the client
       to proceed with registration. This can trip up poorly programmed
       bots which cannot reply to server requests like a PING by not allowing
       them to complete their connection successfully.
       
    
     --enable-warn-bad-reg-cmds
     --disable-warn-bad-reg-cmds (default)
    
       This can open up a security issue with the registration phase. With
       this disabled, unknown commands being sent during the registration
       phase are simply ignored. When this is enabled, however, unknown
       commands will return an error reply (provided passive registrations 
       are not enabled, in which case unknown commands will result in the 
       connection being dropped). When enabled, this follows protocol, but
       leaves you open to attacks that exploit this, as it could be used for
       denial of service attacks by flooding your out-bound traffic.
       

    The following protocols can be toggled:
    
     --enable-protocol-irc2user (default)
     --disable-protocol-irc2user
     
       The irc2 protocol is used with every irc client these days. Unless
       the server is being set up for something specific (such as hubbing)
       it would be wise to have this enabled.
       
     
     --enable-protocol-p13server (default)
     --disable-protocol-p13server
    
       The P13 protocol was the last protocol before the rewrite of austhex.
       It is quite bulky, and only handles star-topology based networks.
       This protocol maintains compatibility back to austhex.servd7.6.
    

     --enable-protocol-p14server
     --disable-protocol-p14server (default)
       
       The P14 protocol is a major advancement in IRC server to server
       protocols. While being tightly implemented it allows itself to be
       compressed easily by a customised compression algorithm and helps
       assist security and lower bandwidth network-wide. The major
       advancement is that it no longer requires a star-topology network
       by implementing 'bone' and 'tendril' links, allowing for well designed
       networks to be virtually split-free with minimal lag.
       This protocol is currently experimental and incomplete.
