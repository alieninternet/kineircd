#
# Example configuratio file for AustHex
# 24/03/2002, Simon Butcher <pickle@austnet.org>
# 
# As you can see, this is very 'C' styled, similar to many configuration
# files around these days (bind etc).
#
# Comments can be C style (/* comment */), C++ style (// comment) or
# UNIX style (# comment). If you need to write something which included
# something which may look like a comment such as a channel name, encase it
# within quotes (", ' or `), such as "#channel".
#
# Values will need to be enclosed within quotes if they include a space, else
# only the first word of a value may be used.
#
# Each class must be enclosed within a pair of parenthesis ('{' and '}').
# Definitions may be of the form "variable = value" or "variable value",
# whichever suits you at the time, or whichever looks neater. Each definition
# MUST be terminated by a semi-colon (';'), however this is optional for
# classes.
#
# This variety of styles is intentional to allow you to use various friendly
# configuration tools which have some (or all) of these capabilities.
#
# For more information, see the ircd.conf(5) man page, as the comments in this
# file often will not explain every detail as explicitly as the documentation
# will.
#
# This file uses a variety of comment, quote and definition styles on purpose
# to show how they can be used.
#
# You must edit this to suit your server!!!
