This is the install directory. The files in here are copied (some of them
generated prior to copying) into their respective locations upon
installation of the daemon. These include files such as language data,
example configuration files, man pages etc.

Anything which isn't generally installed but fits into similar categories
should be places into either the doc or contrib directories as this
directory is only for files which need to be installed.

Should this change?
