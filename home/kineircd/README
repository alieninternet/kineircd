              AustHex IRC Server Daemon Installation Instructions
            -------------------------------------------------------

 1. What is all this about?
    -----------------------
    
    Don't ask me, I just work here.
    
    Oh, you want a real answer? Well, maybe one day I'll write this file
    up properly :) Until then, shhh.



 2. For those who just can't be bothered
    ------------------------------------
 
    Ok, so you're too lazy to read this file? Here's how you can get around
    any serious thinking to make and install this package. Lucky for you,
    this will be easy for you :)
    
    If you want to make and install the package, after untarring the package
    simply type:


       $ make install


    Lucky for you, this will automatically invoke the configuration
    script, compile, and install the package in the default location.
    
    If you wish to just make the package, omit the 'install' parameter.
    
    
    
 3. Package requirements
    --------------------
    
    The following requirements need to be forfilled for this package to work
    correctly:

     - Disk space:
     
       Compilation of the package will normally take up around 5Mb (more
       if compiled for debugging). The package will take up about 1.5Mb
       after installation.


     - C++ Standard Template Library:
      
       You will need a current copy of the C++ STL. All C++ compilers will
       have this these days. Location of the latest STL is below. The latest
       standard template library from SGI includes capabilities which will
       enhance the performance of the daemon immensely, especially under high
       load.
       
       
     - Threading library:
       
       More information later, probably looks like pthreads only though?
       
       
       
 4. Recommended additions
    ---------------------
    
    The following items are recommended

     - OpenSSL:
       
       Adding SSL to the server will allow encrypted secure server to server
       and server to client connections which can be enforced for different
       connection classes or access levels. This can greatly secure your
       server and protect important passwords which may be transmitted over
       the network
    
    
    
 5. Configuration of the package
    ----------------------------
    
    The configuration of the server's compilation time settings can be
    important performance wise
