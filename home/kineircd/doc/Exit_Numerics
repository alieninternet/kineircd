If the server is used in some sort of automated script, the following return
values from the daemon may be used to determine why the server has exited
(each exit point inside the daemon has an individual number to assist with
hunting down potential issues).

  2  | Bad command line parameter(s)
  3  | Could not initialise the IRC Daemon
  4  | Could not execute fork() request
  5  | Caught an ugly signal and had to die (only applies if not dumping core)
  6  | Could not load the given configuration file
