These are dirty notes for implementing IIRC, the inter-irc network stuff.

 * Accepted are numerics and the PRIVMSG, NOTICE, and WHOIS commands
 
 * *NO* bursts, connections are totally stateless unless the optional IIRC
   channels are used.. ('~' prefixed channels).
   
 * Network names, not domains, are used to identify remote nicknames. Since
   the same nickname can exist on multiple networks, all remote nicknames
   have the "#<network name>" suffix. 

    Eg. "nick#networkA" and "nick#networkB" are different, and if you are
    on networkC then "nick#networkC" and "nick" are the same thing.
    
 * Local users should not have the #<network name> suffix, but it should still
   be accepted by both servers and clients.
   
 * IIRC ('~' prefixed) channels will operate similar to # channels, except
   no anonymous mode ('+a') should be allowed.
   
 * SILENCE and ACCEPT commands on the server *must* be able to block from
   remote networks..

    
Example conversation: 'foo' is on networkA, 'bah' is on networkB

from foo's perspective:
  < PRIVMSG bah#networkB :Hello there, how are you?
  > bah#networkB!baz@somehost.com PRIVMSG foo :Hello! I'm good thanks.
  
from bah's perspective:
  > foo#networkA!fooey@anotherhost.com PRIVMSG bah :Hello there, how are you?
  < PRIVMSG foo#networkA :Hello! I'm good thanks.
  
This should integrate nicely with existing clients. In such time as the
trailing user@host can be removed (via CAPAB) that can also be dropped..


Example channel join: 'foo' and 'bah' are the same people

from foo's perspective (joining):
  < JOIN ~qux
  > foo!fooey@anotherhost.com JOIN :~qux
  > :server.networkA 332 foo ~qux :This is a topic
  > :server.networkA 333 foo ~qux bah#networkB 1023180774
  > :server.networkA 353 foo = ~qux :foo @bah#networkB +bazza#networkB
  > :server.networkA 366 foo ~qux :End of NAMES list
  < PRIVMSG ~qux :Hello everyone!
  > bah#networkB!baz@somehost.com PRIVMSG ~qux :Hey foo!
  
from bah's perspective (already in the channel):
  < TOPIC ~qux :This is a topic
  > :server.networkB 332 bah ~qux :This is a topic
   (check the topic to prove a point - note the name of the person setting it)
  < TOPIC ~qux
  > :server.networkB 332 bah ~qux :This is a topic
  > :server.networkB 333 bah ~qux bah 1023180774
   (foo joins)
  > foo#networkA!fooey@anotherhost.com JOIN :~qux
  > foo#networkA!fooey@anotherhost.com PRIVMSG ~qux :Hello everyone!
  < PRIVMSG ~qux :Hey foo!
