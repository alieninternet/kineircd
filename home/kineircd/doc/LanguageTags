'%' char specification notes:

% can be escaped ("\%" - \ char can also have an octal value, eg. \002).
The character after the % can be an upper or lower case letter (it is case
sensitive, so %s and %S are different things), or a char of the following:
%#

Additional data can be placed between the % and the #, such as numbers, etc.
They will control the way the data called is used.

Sequences:

%%
	Return a single '%', same as "\%"

%<n>#
	Return the value in field number n, if it exists for that tag.
	eg.  %4# would return the 4th field.
	What is held in each of these fields depends on each specific tag.
	If a requested field doesn't exist, this will return nothing.

%b
	Bold, same as '\002', however may in the future also represent bold 
	for other protocols

%<q>c
	Return a variable from whatever is using this tag's configuration
	data. This is specific to each module and the value for 'q' will need
	to be discovered from that specific module's documentation. This may
	not even be available, or may be used for other data other than the
	field number such as global data all tags can use.. etc.. 

%<q>C
	Return a variable from the daemon configuration data referred to by its
	"query number, q. The value for the query number is in the list below.
	Some configuration variables are missing due to security reasons, or
	their common use (such as the network name, etc). The query number
	may be one of the following:
		0	adminName
		1	adminLocation
		2	adminEmail
		(more when I can be bothered writing the parser)

%D
	Return the server's description

%N
	Return the network name, or nothing if it has not been set
     
%r
	Reverse/Inverse, same as '\026'; Same conditions as %b
     
%S
	Return the server's hostname
     
%u
	Underline, same as '\037'; Same conditions as %b
