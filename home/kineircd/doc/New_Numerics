Added numerics

Note, these are here for the benifit of 'smart clients' and represent no
real value to other clients.

As you will soon notice, the error numerics I have used are between 590 and
599 inclusive, and the reply numerics I have used are between 800 and 899
inclusive.

Format:

### - DEFINE
      <parameters>
      Notes/Description
_______________________________________________________________________________

590 - ERR_SERVERTOOFULL		
      :This server cannot accept anymore user connections
      May follow an RPL_REDIR (#010)

591 - ERR_TOOMANYFROMYOURCLASS	
      <num_now> <max_allowed> :Too many connections from your class
      
592 - ERR_SERVERTEMPCLOSED	
      :This server is temporarily unavailable
      May follow an RPL_REDIR (#010)

593 - ERR_CANNOTCHANGEUMODE	
      <mode char> :Cannot toggle this user mode [<reason>]
      Cannot change a specific user mode. May also include a reason why

594 - ERR_CANNOTCHANGECHANMODE	
      <mode char> :Cannot modify this channel mode [<reason>]
      Same as above (ERR_CHANNOTCHANGEUMODE) except for channel modes

595 - ERR_CANNOTCHANGESERVERMODE
      <mode char> :Cannot modify this server mode [<reason>]
      Same as above (ERR_CHANNOTCHANGEUMODE) except for server modes

596 - ERR_CANNOTSENDTONICK
      <nickname> :Cannot send to this nickname
      This means the message is being sent to a user who has +R set and the
      sender has not been identified with the network services yet (hasn't
      got a +I on their user modes)

597 - ERR_UNKNOWNSERVERMODE
      <modechar> :Unknown server mode
      Extension to ERR_UNKNOWNMODE, same deal except for server modes :)

599 - ERR_SERVERMODELOCK
      <target> :Cannot change server modes (+L)
      This is returned when the given server cannot accept mode changes by
      any object except its own configuration file or other servers due to
      server mode +L (mode-lock) being set.

800 - RPL_TRACEROUTE	
      <hop #> <ip> <hostname> <ping min> <ping avg> <ping max>

801 - RPL_ENDTRACEROUTE	
      <destination> :End of traceroute
      
802 - RPL_MODECHANGEWARN
      <mode char> :<Warning message>
      This is a replacement of ERR_VWORLDWARN, which can be used for a
      variety of things such as warning operators about turning off wallops
      etc.

803 - RPL_CHANREDIR
      <old channel> <new channel> :Note: You are being redirected
      This is used when a channel is being redirected by the server so that
      the client is aware that it is not 'out of sync' with the server. This
      is designed to be used mainly with 'official' channels on the network
      which may cause some confusion, eg "&IRCopers" and "+IRCopers" would be
      best all pointed towards the single "#IRCopers". This is just a warning
      that the user will not be joining the requested channel but the
      'redirected' channel instead.

804 - RPL_SERVMODEIS
      <server> <modes> <parameters>
      Reply to a /mode <servername> request with the mode setting of a
      particular server. This is essentially a copy of RPL_CHANNELMODEIS,
      except for servers so that clients do not get confused.

805 - RPL_OTHERUMODEIS
      <nickname> <modes>
      Extension to 'RPL_UMODEIS' except only operators/helpers can receive
      this this - To assist in helping users with problems and due to the
      increasing complexity in modes (+R for example) that clients do not
      understand yet (let alone new IRC users), helpers/operators are allowed
      to '/mode nickname' to receive the modes that user has set. They CANNOT
      change these modes. This releives the burdon from the WHO command which
      not only complicates things with strange characters, but also allows
      the general public to view some modes.

806 - RPL_TRACEROUTE_START
      <target> <target FQDN> <target IP> <max hops>
      This is for the /traceroute command, it is the start of a traceroute.
      Target is the given target to traceroute to, the target FQDN is the
      name found for that target, the target IP is the IP found for that
      target, the max hops is the maximum number of hops allowed before
      terminating the traceroute attempt.
      
807 - RPL_TRACEROUTE_HOP      
      <target> <hop number> <hop back number> <hop FQDN> <hop IP> 
       <ping1> <ping2> <ping3> [:<information>]
      Continuation of /traceroute output. Target is the same as above, hop
      number if the number of the hop, while hop back number is the number of
      hops as the reply came back (this can be different). Hop FQDN and 
      hop ip are relevant to the hop being processed, three pings are shown, 
      and an optional 'information' is given in plaintext (no route to host, 
      unauthorised etc etc). If a ping failed it may be replaced with a '*'.
      
808 - RPL_TRACEROUTE_NOHOP
      <target> <hop number> :<information>
      Similar to RPL_TRACEROUTE_HOP except no information was obtained from
      this hop. Information is always given why, even if it is just something
      like "timed out". Information strings are the same as with
      RPL_TRACEROUTE_HOP.
      
809 - RPL_TRACEROUTE_END
      <target> <hops to> <hops from> <min ping> <avg ping> <max ping> 
       :<information>
      End of the traceroute information. Hops to/Hops from are the number of
      hops to/from the target respectively. Min/Avg/Max ping are minimum,
      average and maximum ping times over the course of the traceroute.
      Information is always given.

813 - RPL_WHOISSECURE			
      <nick> <mode> :is connected via a secure connection

814 - RPL_YOURHELPER
      :You are now a network helper
      (From original austhex prior to version 8, this was #380. Moved to
       avoid possible conflict)
      Similar function to YOUREOPER, except for the 'helper' status.
      
815 - RPL_YOURVREMOVER
      :You are not a network virus remover
      (From original austhex prior to version 8, this was #386. Moved to
       avoid possible conflict)
      Same as above -- Virus Remover status.

818 - RPL_LUSERHELPERS
      <number of helpers online> :helper(s) online
      This is complimentary of RPL_LUSEROP, however this is to count the
      number of network staff currently on the network. This could be of
      benifit to other networks such as dalnet as well since AFAIK they also
      have users which have administrative roles but are not operators. On
      AustNet this means people who help maintain the network channel/nickname
      services and help users. This is encouraged to be used!

819 - RPL_TIMEONSERVERIS
      <seconds> <microseconds> <timezone> <flags> :time according to server
      This is the time on the server, used to allow clients to receive a more
      precise time from the server and is sent upon client connection. This
      allows clients to calculate how long an object has been around for since
      all times are send corresponding to the time on the server, such as
      when a topic was set, or if the client uses WATCH how long a user has
      been online for. Clients may also use this to be able to syncronise
      themselves with the server more accurately (since the /TIME command
      cannot be relied on), and allow for the user's perspective of the time
      to be altered to reflect the user's actual timezone.
      Seconds are the number of seconds since Jan 1, 00:00 UTC, 1970. 
      Microseconds are obviously the number of microseconds past the second.
      Rememeber that this is in microseconds and not milliseconds! If you want
      milliseconds (ala old 'C' ftime()) you will need to do a small division
      calculation. This can be safely ignored anyway, it is just here for
      completeness :) Insane client writers could use it to sync a clock
      'accurately' to an IRC server, as long as network lag was calculated,
      but it was not intended to be a replacement for nettime/ntp.
      The timezone is in the format of [+/-]HHMM, east of GMT. This follows
      similar formats found in other internet protocols (SMTP for example)
      and is also easy to read, and parse a-like. For example, GMT would be
      either +0000 or -0000, Melbourne Australia would be +1000, US Eastern
      Time would be -0500, Kathmandu would be +0545 etc etc.
      Flags are a byte - a bitmask. Currently the following bits have meaning:
        0 - Day-light-saving time (in some zones this be inaccurate or defunct)
	1 - Time may not match real time in zone (a bad clock or zone setting)
      eg. a value of 3 means it is day-light-saving time, but the given time
      may not be an accurate representation of the real time in this timezone.

820 - RPL_HELP
      <command> :<parameter string>
      This is a reply to a help request. The parameter string is a string
      giving help to the command specified.
      
821 - RPL_MOREHELP
      <command> :<string>
      This is an addition to RPL_HELP, if requested, and builds on any
      information given above, usually in the form of an explanation of the
      command.

822 - RPL_ENDOFHELP
      <mask> :End of HELP
      Reply to help; mainly to assist when help search masks do not match etc
      This matches RPL_HELP (#820) and RPL_MOREHELP (#821)


Various Extensions:
004 - RPL_MYINFO
      <server hostname> <server version> <user modes> <channel modes>
       <channel modes with parameters> <user modes with parameters>
       <server modes> <server modes with parameters> <version chars>
      ircu started adding 'channel modes with parameters' to the string, this
      has been further extended to contain the server modes (and austnet
      addition) and user modes with parameters since the '+s' user mode in
      ircu and in austhex8 takes a parameter.
      If any field needs to be blank, it can be replaced with a '*'. This may
      be needed on servers that do not have user modes with parameters, or
      server modes/server modes with parameters. The out-of-order sequence
      of the strings are simply due to the way this mode has evolved.
