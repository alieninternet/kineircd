Added ISUPPORT things
---------------------

  ACCEPT=<number>
 -----------------
  This details the number of entries allowed on an ACCEPT list, and also
 shows that the +g/ACCEPT command combination are available.
 
 eg. ACCEPT=100
   Up to 100 nicknames on the ACCEPT list are allowed


  LANGUAGE=<max langs>,<entry>,<entry>...
 -------------------
  This shows that the LANGUAGE command is available for changing the
 language of the replies, and details the languages available. One language
 entry should be surrounded by brackets to show it is the 'default', otherwise
 the first language on the list should be presumed the default. Language names
 are those identical to those defined by the ISO-639-(1/2), and associated
 additions by the IANA. Note that ISO-639-1 is more preferred as it followed
 other internet standards set out by the IANA. 
 See http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/bibcodes.html for a list of codes.
  The 'max langs' field shows how many langauges may be selected at once. The
 LANGUAGE command supports more than one language being specified, both to
 find the best language available but for WHOIS information to show what
 languages a person can speak.
  The language 'i-default' should always be assumed and the server is to
 read 'i-default' as the specified default language. This can aid in more
 simplistic clients, or those who do not read ISUPPORT.
 
 eg. LANGUAGE=6,de,(en),fr,i-klingon
   Show that german, english, french and for the star-trek fans 'klingon' are
  available. English is the default, and therefore i-default is the same as 
  'eng'. Six languages may be selected at once for the WHOIS output.
 
 
 


Added numerics

Format of this list:

### - DEFINE
      <parameters>
      Notes/Description
_______________________________________________________________________________

590 - ERR_SERVERTOOFULL		
      :This server cannot accept anymore user connections
      May follow an RPL_REDIR (#010)


591 - ERR_TOOMANYFROMYOURCLASS	
      <num_now> <max_allowed> :Too many connections from your class


592 - ERR_SERVERTEMPCLOSED	
      :This server is temporarily unavailable
      May follow an RPL_REDIR (#010)


593 - ERR_CANNOTCHANGEUMODE	
      <mode char> :Cannot toggle this user mode [<reason>]
      Cannot change a specific user mode. May also include a reason why


594 - ERR_CANNOTCHANGECHANMODE	
      <mode char> :Cannot modify this channel mode [<reason>]
      Same as above (ERR_CHANNOTCHANGEUMODE) except for channel modes


595 - ERR_CANNOTCHANGESERVERMODE
      <mode char> :Cannot modify this server mode [<reason>]
      Same as above (ERR_CHANNOTCHANGEUMODE) except for server modes


596 - ERR_CANNOTSENDTONICK
      <nickname> :Cannot send to this nickname
      This means the message is being sent to a user who has +R set and the
      sender has not been identified with the network services yet (hasn't
      got a +I on their user modes)


597 - ERR_UNKNOWNSERVERMODE
      <modechar> :Unknown server mode
      Extension to ERR_UNKNOWNMODE, same deal except for server modes :)


599 - ERR_SERVERMODELOCK
      <target> :Cannot change server modes (+L)
      This is returned when the given server cannot accept mode changes by
      any object except its own configuration file or other servers due to
      server mode +L (mode-lock) being set.


800 - RPL_TRACEROUTE	
      <hop #> <ip> <hostname> <ping min> <ping avg> <ping max>


801 - RPL_ENDTRACEROUTE	
      <destination> :End of traceroute


802 - RPL_MODECHANGEWARN
      <mode char> :<Warning message>
      This is a replacement of ERR_VWORLDWARN, which can be used for a
      variety of things such as warning operators about turning off wallops
      etc.


803 - RPL_CHANREDIR
      <old channel> <new channel> :Note: You are being redirected
      This is used when a channel is being redirected by the server so that
      the client is aware that it is not 'out of sync' with the server. This
      is designed to be used mainly with 'official' channels on the network
      which may cause some confusion, eg "&IRCopers" and "+IRCopers" would be
      best all pointed towards the single "#IRCopers". This is just a warning
      that the user will not be joining the requested channel but the
      'redirected' channel instead.


804 - RPL_SERVMODEIS
      <server> <modes> <parameters>
      Reply to a /mode <servername> request with the mode setting of a
      particular server. This is essentially a copy of RPL_CHANNELMODEIS,
      except for servers so that clients do not get confused.


805 - RPL_OTHERUMODEIS
      <nickname> <modes>
      Extension to 'RPL_UMODEIS' except only operators/helpers can receive
      this this - To assist in helping users with problems and due to the
      increasing complexity in modes (+R for example) that clients do not
      understand yet (let alone new IRC users), helpers/operators are allowed
      to '/mode nickname' to receive the modes that user has set. They CANNOT
      change these modes. This relieves the burden from the WHO command which
      not only complicates things with strange characters, but also allows
      the general public to view some modes.


806 - RPL_TRACEROUTE_START
      <target> <target FQDN> <target IP> <max hops>
      This is for the /traceroute command, it is the start of a traceroute.
      Target is the given target to traceroute to, the target FQDN is the
      name found for that target, the target IP is the IP found for that
      target, the max hops is the maximum number of hops allowed before
      terminating the traceroute attempt.


807 - RPL_TRACEROUTE_HOP      
      <target> <hop number> <hop back number> <hop FQDN> <hop IP> 
       <ping1> <ping2> <ping3> [:<information>]
      Continuation of /traceroute output. Target is the same as above, hop
      number if the number of the hop, while hop back number is the number of
      hops as the reply came back (this can be different). Hop FQDN and 
      hop ip are relevant to the hop being processed, three pings are shown, 
      and an optional 'information' is given in plaintext (no route to host, 
      unauthorised etc etc). If a ping failed it may be replaced with a '*'.


808 - RPL_TRACEROUTE_NOHOP
      <target> <hop number> :<information>
      Similar to RPL_TRACEROUTE_HOP except no information was obtained from
      this hop. Information is always given why, even if it is just something
      like "timed out". Information strings are the same as with
      RPL_TRACEROUTE_HOP.


809 - RPL_TRACEROUTE_END
      <target> <hops to> <hops from> <min ping> <avg ping> <max ping> 
       :<information>
      End of the traceroute information. Hops to/Hops from are the number of
      hops to/from the target respectively. Min/Avg/Max ping are minimum,
      average and maximum ping times over the course of the traceroute.
      Information is always given.


810 - RPL_WHOWAS_DETAILS
      <nick> <type> :<information>
      This follows the normal RPL_WHOWASUSER and RPL_WHOWAS_TIME (ref: ircu).
      The nickname corresponds to the nickname of the returning
      information. The type is simply a number (8-bit, range of 0..255) 
      which denotes what type of information is being returned, or rather 
      what 'happened' to this user. Currently the following information
      types have been defined:
        0 - Quit, the user signed off (information = quit message)
	1 - Connection break, something went wrong (information = error)
	2 - Netsplit occured, two servers are given, but may be masked
            depending on their status (hidden or not).
        3 - The user was killed, the information following is the reason
	    for being killed.
	4 - The user changed their nickname. The information will be the
	    user's new nickname. If the user was set invisible (user mode 
	    +i) when the nick change occured, the new nickname will not be
	    available unless the person calling the whowas is a helper
            or an IRC operator.
      eg. Mode = 1, the information could be something like "Read
          error: No route to host" etc)


813 - RPL_WHOISSECURE			
      <nick> <mode> :is connected via a secure connection


814 - RPL_YOURHELPER
      :You are now a network helper
      (From original austhex prior to version 8, this was #380. Moved to
       avoid possible conflict)
      Similar function to YOUREOPER, except for the 'helper' status.


815 - RPL_YOURVREMOVER
      :You are not a network virus remover
      (From original austhex prior to version 8, this was #386. Moved to
       avoid possible conflict)
      Same as above -- Virus Remover status.


818 - RPL_LUSERHELPERS
      <number of helpers online> :helper(s) online
      This is complimentary of RPL_LUSEROP, however this is to count the
      number of network staff currently on the network. This could be of
      benefit to other networks such as dalnet as well since AFAIK they also
      have users which have administrative roles but are not operators. On
      AustNet this means people who help maintain the network channel/nickname
      services and help users. This is encouraged to be used!


819 - RPL_TIMEONSERVERIS
      <seconds> <microseconds> <timezone> <flags> :time according to server
      This is the time on the server, used to allow clients to receive a more
      precise time from the server and is sent upon client connection. This
      allows clients to calculate how long an object has been around for since
      all times are send corresponding to the time on the server, such as
      when a topic was set, or if the client uses WATCH how long a user has
      been online for. Clients may also use this to be able to synchronise
      themselves with the server more accurately (since the /TIME command
      cannot be relied on), and allow for the user's perspective of the time
      to be altered to reflect the user's actual timezone.
      Seconds are the number of seconds since Jan 1, 00:00 UTC, 1970. 
      Microseconds are obviously the number of microseconds past the second.
      Remember that this is in microseconds and not milliseconds! If you want
      milliseconds (ala old 'C' ftime()) you will need to do a small division
      calculation. This can be safely ignored anyway, it is just here for
      completeness :) Insane client writers could use it to sync a clock
      'accurately' to an IRC server, as long as network lag was calculated,
      but it was not intended to be a replacement for nettime/ntp.
      The timezone is in the format of [+/-]HHMM, east of GMT. This follows
      similar formats found in other internet protocols (SMTP for example)
      and is also easy to read, and parse a-like. For example, GMT would be
      either +0000 or -0000, Melbourne Australia would be +1000, US Eastern
      Time would be -0500, Kathmandu would be +0545 etc etc.
      Flags are a byte - a bitmask. Currently the following bits have meaning:
        0 - Day-light-saving time (in some zones this be inaccurate or defunct)
	1 - Time may not match real time in zone (a bad clock or zone setting)
      eg. a value of 3 means it is day-light-saving time, but the given time
      may not be an accurate representation of the real time in this timezone.


820 - RPL_HELP
      <command> :<parameter string>
      This is a reply to a help request. The parameter string is a string
      giving help to the command specified.
      

821 - RPL_MOREHELP
      <command> :<string>
      This is an addition to RPL_HELP, if requested, and builds on any
      information given above, usually in the form of an explanation of the
      command.


822 - RPL_ENDOFHELP
      <mask> :End of HELP
      Reply to help; mainly to assist when help search masks do not match etc
      This matches RPL_HELP (#820) and RPL_MOREHELP (#821)


823 - RPL_NOTACCEPTED
      <nickname> :is in server side ignore mode (+g) but has been notified
       you wish to talk to them
      Different spin on using a notice like hybrid does -- this is designed so
      that smarter clients can tell the user exactly why the message was not
      sent in whatever interface they require. The nickname is the target
      the user tried to send the message to.


824 - RPL_ACCEPTNOTICE
      <nick> <user> <host> :is messaging you. You are in server side ignore 
       mode (+g). Use the ACCEPT command if you wish to talk to them.
      Like above, this is a replacement for hybrid's notice version of someone
      trying to message you. More-so than the above numeric, this is designed
      for clients that are smart enough so that they can either set up
      automatic accepts for certain people from certain hosts (friends), or
      to show a pop-up box etc etc. Same as hybrid, this message is not
      repeated constantly (see their mode +g docs). The sender will give more
      information such as username/hostname etc.


825 - RPL_KNOCKING
      <channel> :has received your knocking
      Confirmation that a /KNOCK is being sent


826 - RPL_ACCEPTED
      <nick> <user> <host> :has added you to their ACCEPT list
      Indicate that a user has added you to their accept list. See
      RPL_ACCEPTNOTICE for information on the fields, as this works in 
      the same way.


827 - RPL_YOURLANGUAGEIS 
      <language code> <charset> :<language/variation name>
      When listing languages (LANGUAGE command with no parameters) this 
      starts off the list showing the user their current language setting.
      The language code follows ISO-639-(1/2)/IANA assigned language codes, 
      and the charset is an IANA/MIME style compliant character which is used 
      to view the language selected (the client should change to this for 
      proper viewing). The charset field is used to show which character set 
      should be used when viewing this language correctly, and follows 
      IANA/MIME style specifications 
      (see http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets; eg. ISO-8859-1,
      ISO-10646-UCS-4 etc). The language/variation name is the name of the 
      language IN that language. Eg. not 'German' but 'Deutsch', not 'Spanish' 
      but 'Espa¤ol' (hopefully that's an n with a tilde), not 'French' but
      'Francais' (I cannot do a cedilla on the c on this terminal) etc etc.
      Note that this ONLY refers to the server specific language selection and
      does not show other languages. The WHOIS language information serves
      that purpose, but the client should already know what other languages
      it has set.


828 - RPL_LANGUAGE
      <language code> <version> <maintainer> <charset> * 
       :<language/variation name>
      A list item for listing languages. The language code is the 
      ISO-639-(1/2)/IANA assigned language name, the version is the version of 
      the language file being used, and the maintainer is an e-mail address 
      of the person who maintains that particular language file for contact 
      with regards to updates/corrections etc. The character set is the same
      as above, an IANA/MIME compliant character set name. The '*' is a 
      field for possible future use and should be ignored for now. The 
      language/variation name is given to show the name of the language, and 
      is the name of the language IN that language, as with RPL_YOURLANGUAGEIS.


829 - RPL_ENDOFLANGUAGES
      :End of LANGUAGE list
      Mark the end of a language list.


830 - RPL_WHOIS_LANGUAGE
      <language codes> <charset>
      This is an optional extra to the WHOIS output, showing what language
      a user is using. The 'language codes' field is a comma-delimetered list
      of languages a person can speak (in order of preference, highest
      first, lowest last). The charset is the user's currently presumed
      charset (relative to their server language setting, which may not be
      true network-wide. Additional fields may be added to this in the future.


880 - ERR_NOKNOCK
      <channel> :<reason>
      Indicate to a client that a knock to the given channel was not
      performed. The channel is the channel the user tried to 'knock' on,
      and the reason is the reason for it failing (eg. 'channel is open',
      'you are on that channel' or 'you are already invited').


881 - ERR_NOLANGUAGE
      <langage code> :is an unknown language to me
      This is returned for every language the server does not know until a 
      known language has been reached. Futher unknown languages are ignored
      from there on. This helps a client rule out languages that are not
      available with one command issued to the server. The unknown languages
      will still be available to other users/servers, however, and may be
      selected for other servers' output.


882 - ERR_NOMORELANGS
      <max languages> :No more languages can be set
      Tell the client it cannot set any more languages, the maximum given.
      

Extensions:
004 - RPL_MYINFO
      <server hostname> <server version> <user modes> <channel modes>
       <channel modes with parameters> <user modes with parameters>
       <server modes> <server modes with parameters> <version chars>
      ircu started adding 'channel modes with parameters' to the string, this
      has been further extended to contain the server modes (and austnet
      addition) and user modes with parameters since the '+s' user mode in
      ircu and in austhex8 takes a parameter.
      If any field needs to be blank, it can be replaced with a '*'. This may
      be needed on servers that do not have user modes with parameters, or
      server modes/server modes with parameters. The out-of-order sequence
      of the strings are simply due to the way this mode has evolved.
