Server notices are rather different to the old server notices from
austhex.servd7, and previous version of ircd. These days most (if not all)
operators are using scripts to re-interpret generated server notices and
output them in whatever form is comfortable to them (eg. a different window
etc). 

The new server notice format, while being totally incompatible with the old
format, aims to reduce the traffic produced by the generated server notices,
while also maintaining a small level of readability (even though readability
is not much of an issue anymore, it is still important).

Take for example the difference between the following server notices:

 -pacific.nsw.au.austnet.org- *** Notice -- Received KILL message for
   FoBbY. From sprint.austnet.org Path: netspace.vic.au.austnet.org!
   iinet.wa.au.austnet.org!services.hub.austnet.org!sprint.austnet.org
   (Banned from AustNet: No Clones.)

In that line, most of which is generated for readability and for backwards
compatibility to a client (the compatibility was only a formatting thing
anyway), 171 chars are removed. The new line would look like this:

 -pacific.nsw.au.austnet.org- Ksprint.austnet.org FoBbY Banned from AustNet: 
   No Clones.

Each server notice comes via the 'NOTICE' command ('SNOTICE' event in mIRC). 
Each notice begins with a single character (which will have to be stripped 
before the data is delimetered in the script) which is CASE SENSITIVE ('A' and 
'a' are different) and denotes the type of the notice, as described below. 

These codes also correspond to the MODE command's +s tags for turning them
on and off, so this table serves as a table for them too :)

Note that in the table below, a field ending with '...' means the rest of
the line will contain that field. Eg:
The format for 'K' (Kill notice):
  <killer> <nick> <reason...>
The output will be:
  KNickOP [Pickle] Kill requested by pickle
                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ -- all of this is the last field

Quick lookup table:

The following is a rough list of what is available and breif definitions:
  +c    Configuration/Rehash/Garbo, etc - Housekeeping information; general
  +D	Debugging information
  +g    GLOBOPS messages
  +h    HELPME messages
  +H	High-Traffic Mode messages
  +k	Kill notifications
  +l    LOCOPS messages
  +n	Network connect/squit/tendril-bone-swaps etc
  +o	OPER commands, attempts, and deops
  +s	User connection and disconnection notices
  +S	General out-of-sync errors
  +t	Target sync errors
  +T	Timestamp sync errors
