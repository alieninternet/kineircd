List of chars after the /version information, since they are laborious and
annoying. Many of these follow original irc standards, but most don't.

Why have these lil' blighters? They can help other IRC operators or
developers quickly determine why a function of the server is or isn't working,
or why something is working in a different way without having to waste a lot
of time.

Most if not all letters are set by defines in config.h; As you can tell
these are NOT to determine the current settings in the ircd.conf file, since
there are other ways of looking at them (the STATS command for example).
These are used to see what options this IRCd has compiled in, and what needs
a recompilation to change. It also shows which modules are active.
