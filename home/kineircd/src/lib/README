This is the lib directory, where the kineircd library (the main core of the
daemon) is kept. The core of the daemon is a library to facilitate complex
modular code using shared libraries to save on duplication of code. It would
also allow the facilitation of 'virtual hosted' IRC servers while dropping the
redundant copies of code in memory, however that's not recommended.

Parts of the library have been broken down into categories and placed into
sub-directories. This was done to organise the code in a neater fashion
(without enormous long file names) and also due to certain parts of the
library being comprised of several small classes (such as the socket code).
