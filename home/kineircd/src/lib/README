This is the lib directory, where the kineircd library (the main core of the
daemon) is kept. The core of the daemon is a library to facilitate complex
modular code using shared libraries to save on duplication of code. A side
advantage is that is also would also allow the facilitation of 'virtual hosted'
IRC servers while dropping the redundant copies of code in memory.

Parts of the library have been broken down into categories and placed into
sub-directories. This was done to organise the code in a neater fashion
(without enormous long file names) and also due to certain parts of the
library being comprised of several small classes (such as the socket code).

The version 'INFO' information is created from the version.txt file, also
located in this directory. Please note that it is a violation of the license
agreement to remove the copyright information from this file, including the
names of the KineIRCd developers. You a strongly recommended against editing
the version.txt file. Please see the 'COPYING' file in the top directory of
the KineIRCd package for more information.
