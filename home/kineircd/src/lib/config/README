This is the configuration parsing and configuration variable assignment
handling code for the core of the IRC daemon. It's left modular so modules
may assign additional configuration variables if they need to. 

In reality, two configuration parsers exist here. The first and primary
parser is designed to parse the modern and flexible C-style configuration
files. Additionally, an old-style parser is available which can be used as
well.

Note to developers: The old-style parser needs FINISHING. It's time
consuming and brain numbing to complete, however if you get the time and
feel like you want to please feel free to talk to me about it -
