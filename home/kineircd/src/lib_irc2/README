This is a tiny library which is used exclusively by any protocol module
utilising the IRC-2 protocol. Instead of reinventing the wheel in each
protocol that traditionally uses the same parser, we are able to emulate
somewhat the traditional IRC daemon structure by using one single and
complete parser.

I would like to point out to anyone reading the code that the term 'message'
used through-out this section of the code (and anything which uses this
library) relates to a message of protocol data, and not a message passed with
a command on IRC through a command.
