This is a tiny library which is used exclusively by any protocol module
utilising the IRC-2 protocol. Instead of reinventing the wheel in each
protocol that traditionally uses the same parser, we are able to emulate
somewhat the traditional IRC daemon structure by using one single and
complete parser.
