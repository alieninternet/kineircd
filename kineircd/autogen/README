This directory contains definition files used by GNU AutoGen to generate
certain files (from templates). They are only used by developers who need to
regenerate parts of the source code. Files which are generated from these
definition files (and their respective templates through-out the package)
are generated prior to distribution, therefore it's most likely you don't
need to even consider them.

Note that all of these files are copyrighted. Some of them are licensed
under GNU GPL, some are licensed as public domain. These public domain files
are intended for use by other IRC developers, and can be included in any
package as long as the copyright remains. The GNU GPL licensed files relate
directly to KineIRCd, however, and are probably not useful outside of this
package.
