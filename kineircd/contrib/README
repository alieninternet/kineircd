This directory contains contributed "stuff" which is good as a companion to
the IRC daemon but is NOT SUPPORTED by the developers of the server. You
will need to contact the specific author of the contributed "stuff" rather
than the KineIRCd Development Team. Queries to the KineIRCd Development Team
will most likely be ignored.

Future plans are primarily that scripts which can correctly parse the IRC 
Daemon's shortened server notice output and new numerics/commands will live
here for various IRC clients. If anyone else has something small but very
very useful they wish to have bundled with the IRC daemon, please contact 
me - pickle@alien.net.au
