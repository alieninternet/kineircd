This is the install directory. The files in here are copied (some of them
generated prior to copying) into their respective locations upon
installation of the daemon. These include files such as man pages,
example configuration files, etc.

Anything which doesn't normally get installed by us (i.e. automatically)
should go into the doc or contrib directories.
