This is a relatively small library which is used exclusively by any protocol
module utilising the IRC-2 protocol. Instead of reinventing the wheel in each
protocol that traditionally uses the same parser, we are able to emulate
somewhat the traditional IRC daemon structure by using one single and
mostly complete parser.

The library includes rudimentary entities, protocol support functions (such
as breaking down/forming identity strings), and of course a parser. The parser
simply breaks down each protocol message into a set of data including the
origin (if any), the command and any parameters, according to basic protocol
rules set out in RFC1459.

I would like to point out to anyone reading the code that the term 'message'
used through-out this section of the code (and anything which uses this
library) relates to a message of protocol data, and not a message passed with
a command on IRC through a command such as PRIVMSG.
