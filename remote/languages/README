Notes on the format of these files
----------------------------------

  Each line beginning with a '#' is considered a comment. The '#' character
 is allowed to have white-space preceeding it and still be considered a
 comment. Each line of data for the language engine is in the following
 simple format:
 
     tag = data

 eg.

     WORD = word
     WORD_PLURAL = words
     PHRASE = This is a phrase

  Each tag must be on a separate line, as text cannot span multiple lines. Tags
 are labeled in such a way to show their origin depending on their prefix. For
 example, KINE_FOO relates to KineIRCd in general, and IRC2USER_BAH relates to
 the irc2user protocol module.

  Tags not in the language engine's database are simply ignored to allow for
 backwards compatibility of the language data files. Tags that are present
 in the language engine but are not defined in this file will be resolved as
 a string containing a question mark ("?").

  Tags with the '.' prefix have a special purpose, such as an internal
 variable or instructions for the parser. Examples of these are '.REVISION',
 '.LANGNAME', '.PREFIX' etc.
 
  All tags are not case-sensitive, therefore 'foo', 'FOO', 'FoO' all are
 identified to the langtags engine as the same tag.
 
  Tags which get redefined will simply replace the previous definition, and as
 such multiple definitions are not possible.

  If multiple language files are loaded using the same language code, the data
 is merged. Any redefined tags will be overwritten, and previously undefined
 tags will be appended to the language data.



Editing language files
----------------------

  Since language files are to be written in UTF-8, they should be edited in an
 appropriate editor. Notepad for Windows XP has UTF-8 support, but is hopeless
 at providing the level of support required (and likes to mess around with the
 file in ugly ways).
 
  Ignore how the file is represented in most programs. Chances are, characters
 turn into all sorts of funny looking things purely because that program is
 incapable of supporting the UTF-8 character set, or presumes it's another
 character set (Windows Notepad makes such presumptions).
 
  My recommendation is to use UniRed. From what I've seen, it's stable. It
 doesn't fart around with the file format, and supports UTF-8 perfectly. You
 can download it from http://sf.net/projects/unired
 
  When using UniRed, that make sure when you open a language file you select
 "UTF-8" from the "Charset" drop-down box. Other Unicode/UTF-8 editors will
 have a similar requirement.



Control tags
------------

  Various 'control tags' are defined. These control how the language file is
 parsed.


 .REVISION	(required)

    This is the 'version' of the language file. It must be a number, 
   without spaces or any special symbols. There is no specific format 
   defined for the number, however KineIRCd developers should remember that
   the number becomes a 32-bit integer. It's recommended to use the same
   format commonly used for DNS zone records - that is YYYYMMDDPP where
   YYYY = year, MM = month, DD = day, HH = hour, P = patch/modification level.
   
    eg. 20020823110


 .MAINTAINER	(optional)

    This is an e-mail address of who to contact regarding the language file.


 .LANGCODE	(required)
 
    This must be a registered language code defined by ISO-639-1, ISO-639-2 or
   by the IANA. Please see RFC-3066 for more information, including
   information on how to register a new languages/dialects. 
   
    See http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/bibcodes.html for more
   information on the ISO-639-1 and ISO-639-2 standards. For information
   on the IANA registrations (dialects and 'i-*' names), please see
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-tags for details.


 .LANGNAME	(required)

    This is the name of the language in use, it should be the same as the
   name associated with the ISO-639-(1/2) or IANA Language Tags. The name of
   the language should be in it's own language, eg. 'English' in English,
   'Deutsch' in German etc.


 .LANGNOTE	(optional)

    Any additional notes you need. Keep this brief. This is intended to
   be used to supplement the language name (above). Eg. 'x-git' might be
   taken the wrong way and it might be worth stating in a note that the
   language is intended to be humourous.



Substitutions within tag data
-----------------------------

    %p0 -> %p9	- Parameters, depending on the tag. (params 1..10)
    %P0 -> %p9	- More parameters, rarely used (params 11..20)
  
	%%	- A percentage sign
	%a	- The name of the server's administrator
	%A	- The contact point of the server's administrator (e-mail)
	%d	- The description of the server
	%L	- The location of the server
	%n	- The name of the server (its hostname)
	%N	- The name of the network

	\\	- A slash
       \nnn	- An escaped character. All characters, except #0, are valid.
        \b	- Toggle bold (same as \002)
	\c	- Beginning of colour sequence (not recommended; Same as \003)
	\g	- Beep (only supported on some IRC clients; same as \007)
